## Noise Monitor

### Project description
I got a task that monitors the polykids' noise, I did some research there should have some noise level in the kindergarten, you can click [here] to get more information, this a Ministry of Education website.
(https://www.education.govt.nz/early-childhood/licensing-and-regulations/the-regulatory-framework-for-ece/licensing-criteria/centre-based-ece-services/premises-and-facilities/general/pf12-heating-lighting-noise-and-ventilation/)

![Noise level](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/soften-portfolio-jiqi963.github.io/blob/master/img/week22.png?raw=true)

At the moment, we do not have any user story, because of this project since a long time ago and it does not real-work anyway since the time, by the way, I talking with the team member and Imagine some user story to the repository.

Such like:

As a user, I want to monitor the noise on Polykids area.

As a user, I want to know what time is more noisy. etc. Monday morning is quite, Friday afternoon is most noisy.

And something else

### Challenge

The most difficult thing for me is to use a different platform, I only have some experience with Arduino in last semester. However, this monitor will use Mbed

### Between Arduino and Mben

There have something same, like the language, they both use C/C++, able to use same sensor and peripherals 

Also there have something difference:

#### Different IDE

The Mbed IDE is an in-browser compiler that allows you to easily import other people's source code. it requires internet access.
The Arduino IDE is an easy to use software, you can development local.

![Mbed IDE](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/soften-portfolio-jiqi963.github.io/blob/master/img/week21.jpg?raw=true)

#### Compiler method

The Mbed shows up as a flash drive when you plug it into your computer via USB, then develop online and download the file and copy to the mbed(flash).
Arduino is easier than Mbed, you can coding and compiler on the same IDE. Simply to choose the port that you link to the computer and click the correct board that all.
