# Topic

I design a treavel app for the cellphone.

## Explanation

- Which tools/applications you used and why

I going to use Photoshop which has the almost function that can help me to edit the picture.

- How you used the features of these tools/applications

I use the rectangle tool to draw input field and search bar.
I use horizontal tool to type text such as ‘check-in, ‘check-out ‘, ‘search’.

- Why you believe your use of tools/applications was competent

I have some exercise in the class time and Photoshop is popular software which easier to find the tutorial in YouTube.

- How you exported your work and why you did it that way

I going to export a PNG file and update it in my portfolio.

- How you managed assets during project work

Research and aim an area (App or website)
Draw a wireframe
Double-check my idea with the lecturer
mockup

- How you used the elements and principles in your designs

I going to design a travel app, By the way, I did some research, almost travel app have similar home page such like the city name of you are going to, check-in and check-out date, and some useful buttons.

- How your designs are consistent with conventions and existing material

A wide range of uses of purple and blue, most of the rectangles use round corner except the label.
All borders have no edges, most rectangles use external shadows, and labels use bevel emboss
Align most (99.99%) of the rectangles and text horizontally and vertically, maintaining consistent spacing
I draw some icon such as rent car, transfer and weather.

- What decisions you made about aesthetics and user experience
User more high recognition icon.
Use lines to make the picture clearer and the layers more distinct
The main content is distinguished by lines and spacing.
Align most (99.99%) of the rectangles and text horizontally and vertically, maintaining consistent spacing
By the way, all element has color so the background I use black and white.
