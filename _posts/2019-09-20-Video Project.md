# Topic

I working a noisy monitor for Polykids that is an IoT project for my project paper(IN700), by the way, I think introducing this monitor should be interesting.

## Important Link

All answer of the question can find in [Here](https://github.com/jiqi963/Multimedia/blob/master/doc/ExplanationVideoProject.pdf)

Outline and the shotlist can find in [Here](https://github.com/jiqi963/Multimedia/blob/master/doc/OutlineAndShotlist.pdf)

You can find the Video [Here](https://youtu.be/pdFCACDtebo)

### Explain

- Which tools/applications you used and why?

I use After effects (AE) to edit the video and use Media encoder to export the file.
It easy to find the tutorial on YouTube for those two applications. And there has some awesome function that can make the video more aesthetics and cool.

- How you used the features of these tools/applications?

I use a lot of function in AE, such as:
3D camera tracker: tracker an object then put some explain Text around it.
Adjustment: Color, contrast, exposure, and saturation
Backward effect: use it to transition between two scenes.
Pixel Polly: use it to make the text fancier.
Mask: use it to put some pictures on the video or behind the video.
Card wipe: use it to make a Logo.

- Why you believe your use of tools/applications was competent?

After I search in Google, a lot of people use AE to edit the video even to edit the movie.
I just need to use AE to cut the video and put some awesome visual effect, so I believe it can competent.

- How you exported your work and why yous did it that way?

After I use AE to edit it, I export it to an AVI format file then upload it to YouTube.
The AVI format file is easy to the player for almost operation system and it has suit size and resolution.

- How you managed assets during project work?

Write a script
Make a storyboard
Make a shoot list
Shoot plenty video with different agile
Use AE edit the video

- How you used the elements and principles in your designs?

I will introduce a noisy monitor that designs for Polykids, the manager of the kindergarten wants to know how loud in the area.
The noisy monitor has three indicator light, when the decibel (DB) lower than 75DB will turn on the green light, when the DB higher than 85 it will turn on the red one, otherwise will turn on the yellow light.

- How your designs are consistent with conventions and existing material?

Did some color adjustment to make the clips look more consistent.
Reframe the post-production to make the clips consistent
Use a background music throughout the video, except for the introduction section

- What decisions you made about aesthetics and user experience?

Keep the lighting suitable
Stabilize the camera as much as possible
Keep the picture color as consistent as possible
Explain the basic knowledge of electronic components
Make a title animation

#### Establishing Shots

* Project room
* Classroom (Next Robâ€™s office)
* Darkroom
* Somewhere

#### Transition

Maybe use some function in After Effects to make it.

####  Logline

* I going to introduce the noise monitor that design for Polykids

* Scene Project room 60 seconds
I will collection all stuff that the noise monitor need
I will design the printable case in there

* Scene Darkroom 30 seconds
I will solder the circuit in there

* Scene Classroom 30 seconds
I will 3D print the case in there

* Scene somewhere 60 seconds
I will introduce the noise monitor in somewhere

### Storyboard

The storyboard show my establishing shots

- Collection all stuff that the noise monitor need
- Solder the circuit
- Design the monitor case
- 3d print the case
- Test the monitor in the home
- Introduce the noisy monitor

### Evidence

Here is some evidence to prove me use some fancy function with `After effects`

#### GaussianBlur

When I link two video, I use gaussianblur to transition them

![Evidence 1](https://github.com/jiqi963/Multimedia/blob/master/img/video/GaussianBlur.png?raw=true)


#### Logo

I make a title and logo when the video start

![Evidence 2](https://github.com/jiqi963/Multimedia/blob/master/img/video/logo.png?raw=true)


#### ScaleOrFlipALayeranBlur

Scale and flip the layout when I collect all stuff.

![Evidence 4](https://github.com/jiqi963/Multimedia/blob/master/img/video/ScaleOrFlipALayer.png?raw=true)


#### MotionTileEffect

When I scale and flip the layout some area is empty(blank), so I use motion tile to fill them.
