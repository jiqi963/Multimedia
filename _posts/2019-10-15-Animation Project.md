## Topic
I make a animation that merry christmas.

### Explanation

- Which tools/applications you used and why

I use Adobe Illustrate to make character which has the almost function that can help me to edit the picture.
I use Adobe Animate to make the animation which can edit the keyframe and draw some simple shape.

- How you used the features of these tools/applications

##### Adobe Illustrate
I use line tool to draw Santa and his deer
I use selection tool to change the edge of character

##### Adobe Animate
I use motion tween that can make the character move

- Why you believe your use of tools/applications was competent

I have some exercise in the class time and Adobe software is popular which easier to find the tutorial in YouTube.

- How you exported your work and why you did it that way

I use export option to export a video and upload it to YouTube, that easy everyone to watch it.

- How you managed assets during project work

Research and make a plan
Make a storyboard
Use Illustrate make character
Import to Animate and make the animation

- How you used the elements and principles in your designs

Because Christmas is coming, I decided to make an animation about Santa Claus. 

I know New Zealand's Christmas in the summer, however, the Santa almost ware the winter cloth and snow is more suitable for him. So I make some snow in the animation.
Santa Claus reins the deer and sends a gift to every family.

- How your designs are consistent with conventions and existing material

I did some research that Santa Claus has eight reindeer, however, the animation only 30 seconds so I only make two deer.
Snowy almost all scenes except the forest.
Add some subtitle that makes it easier to understand.
All house design by the same designer(same style)

- What decisions you made about aesthetics and user experience

Draw a Santa and reindeer by myself.
Keep all stuff under suitable size.
When Santa far away, make it as small as far.
