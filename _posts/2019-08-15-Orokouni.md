## Orokonui
### The mainly tesk for our team
I know we should work the gate sensor with Orokonui ecosanctuary on the first day when I arrived the here

trip to Orokonui


#### Check the gates
We walk around the main area(I think) in the Orokonui, and check some gate that we need to improve.
There has 7 - 8 gates and each one is different, so we need to take one or two gates and think about a good ideal that can reach the goal.
We checked three gates on the day, however, We need to set up the new antenna.
