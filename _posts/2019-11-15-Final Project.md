# The final project

[Final project](https://github.com/jiqi963/Multimedia/blob/master/final/game/Hero.html)

##	Which tools/applications you used and why

I going to make a flash game so I will use Animate and Illustrator
It easy to find the tutorial on YouTube for those two applications. And there has some awesome function that can make the game more aesthetics and cool.

## How you used the features of these tools/applications

- Animate:
I use keyframe to locate the character and use 
I use code snippet to make the logic like go to some frame or stop on this frame.
I use button symbol let user to choose the option (Yes or No)
I use motion tween to let the character to move.

- Illustration:
I use point tool to adjust the image
I use anchor tool to adjust the line
 
## Why you believe your use of tools/applications was competent

I have a bit exercise on the class for Animate, this’s main reason I use it.
When I got some resource from google, I use Illustrator to adjust it then it will more suit my game.
However, I going to produce a flash game, Animate should be the best choice.

## How you exported your work and why you did it that way

After I use Animate produce it, I publish it on Animate, the final produce are HTML and JS files.
There has some interaction in the game, so html should be a good choice.
 
## How you managed assets during project work

I use Trolle to organize all the work

- Determine the type of project
- Discover other similar game (i.e. Space quest)
- Write a script on Trolle
- Make a storyboard
- Use Trello to organize all step
- Search resource from google
- Make it step by step

## How you used the elements and principles in your designs

I will produce a game which kind like flash game, the topic is a hero saved a kingdom and princess.
First, the man needs some weapon, he can find it on somewhere
Then he will beat a monster finally save the kingdom.

All elements from the website Freepik.

I thought I can make a more complex loop like IF-ELSE, however, I don't know how it works in the Animate.
 
## How your designs are consistent with conventions and existing material

Choose same style background
Did some colour adjustment to make the scenes look more consistent.
Use background music throughout the game


## What decisions you made about aesthetics and user experience

Keep the character’s size suitable
Have a different end (Multichoice)
All material has the same style
Use a comfortable background music
